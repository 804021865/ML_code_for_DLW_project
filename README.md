# ML_code_for_DLW_project
These are the machine learning codes for my Direct Laser Writing Process Study Project.
Based on the dataset from finite element analysis of direct laser writing on polyimide, 
machine learning models can be constructed to accelerate the temperature prediction,
and the importance of each feature/parameter can be also quantitatively evaluated.
Anyone can replicate my simulations through running these codes.
